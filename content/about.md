I'm a cloud builder and tech enthusiast with a strong passion for OpenStack, distributed systems, and custom infrastructure solutions.
What drives me is the challenge of taking an idea sometimes just a sketch or a late-night thought and turning it into a working project that others can use, learn from, or build upon.

I love exploring how systems work from the ground up: installing, configuring, and experimenting until every piece fits together. For me, it's not just about deploying technology, but about understanding it deeply, pushing it further, and making it accessible.

I try to share as much as possible about what I learn. Writing is a challenge for me because of my dyslexia, so I use AI tools to help me polish and correct my texts. But that never stops me I genuinely enjoy sharing my passion and knowledge with others, whether it's through articles, discussions, or talks.

I also give conferences and presentations on different topics I've worked on, from cloud deployments to scalable infrastructures and experimental systems. Meeting people, exchanging ideas, and passing on what I've learned and learn from others is always a pleasure.

For me, every project is both a playground and a laboratory a way to explore, learn, and grow. Always curious, always building, always looking for the next challenge to tackle.
