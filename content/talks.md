I really enjoy sharing my work and passion for cloud and infrastructure projects with others.
Here you can find the talks Iâ€™ve given so far. For now, all of them have been in **French**, but I hope they can still be useful or inspiring for anyone interested in cloud technologies, OpenStack, or infrastructure projects.

## MeetUp 15 Years of OpenStack

This presentation goes back over all the issues We faced during the creation of the cloud, the many mistakes We made along the way, and how we fixed them.

This talk presents the progress achieved thanks to the budget we obtained for the project, explains where we currently stand, and gives an outlook on when it will be available.

## ESGI Linux Day 2023

This presentation was the **starting point** of the cloud project. We had just taken over the ESGI Laboinfra and were planning to turn it into a cloud platform.
It includes a technical OpenStack demo to show its potential and spark interest among ESGI students.
